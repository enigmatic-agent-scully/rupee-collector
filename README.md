# Rupee Collector!

This fun game challenges players to figure out the random values assigned to four different color rupees and use that knowledge to add the values until they equal a randomly chosen number.

## Instructions

Collect enough rupees to buy the item! Be careful, some pesky fairies keep changing each rupee's value each time you purchase an item. 

You won't know the value of each rupee until you click on it!

Click on the rupees to increase your payment. Once your payment amount is equal to the item price, your inventory will increase by one item! Careful, though -- if your payment is greater than the item price, the fairies will take away one item from your inventory. 

Good luck!

### Getting Started

Click on one of the rupees to begin adding to your payment amount!
